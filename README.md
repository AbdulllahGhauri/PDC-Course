# ⚙️ Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) — Course Project

## 🧩 Introduction
This project demonstrates practical implementations of key concepts from the **Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC)** course.  
It focuses on understanding how **threads, processes, synchronization, and communication** enable efficient parallel execution and scalable computing.  
Each chapter presents simple Python programs that make complex ideas easier to grasp through real-world examples.

---

## 📘 Overview
The course explores how computation can be divided across multiple processors or systems to improve **speed, performance, and reliability**.  
By applying both **thread-based** and **process-based** models, students learn how to manage concurrency, coordinate shared resources, and communicate between independent tasks.  

Each section includes example codes, explanations, and comparative insights to reinforce practical understanding.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This course project showcases the practical power of **Parallel and Distributed Computing**.  
From simple thread coordination to multi-process parallelism, each chapter demonstrates how to build efficient, safe, and concurrent Python programs.

> 💡 “Parallelism is not just about speed — it’s about doing more, efficiently and intelligently.”
